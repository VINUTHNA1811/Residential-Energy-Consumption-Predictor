# üè† Residential Energy Consumption Predictor

A Streamlit application for predicting residential energy consumption using a machine learning model. This tool helps homeowners and analysts forecast energy usage and understand the key factors that influence it.

**Live Demo:** [Check out the live app here\!](https://residential-energy-consumption-predictor-vinuthnabudde.streamlit.app/)

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Interactive Prediction Tool**: Input various home, environmental, and time-based factors to get an instant energy consumption forecast.
  - **Dashboard & History**: Visualize past predictions, view key metrics (like average and peak consumption), and analyze trends over time.
  - **Feature Importance Analysis**: Understand which factors (e.g., house size, temperature, income) have the greatest impact on the prediction, powered by the Random Forest model's insights.
  - **Modern UI/UX**: A clean, responsive, and visually appealing interface built with custom CSS on top of Streamlit's framework.
  - **Multi-Page Navigation**: Easily switch between the Home, Predictor, Dashboard, and About pages.
  - **State Management**: Predictions are stored in the session state, allowing for a persistent history within a single user session.

## üöÄ How to Run the App Locally

To get this application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed. The application uses several libraries that you can install with `pip`.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

*(Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub details).*

### 2\. Install Dependencies

The application relies on the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3\. Place the Model File

The application requires a pre-trained machine learning model file named `Random_forest_model (2).pkl`. Please ensure this file is in the root directory of the project.

### 4\. Run the Streamlit App

Once all the dependencies are installed and the model file is in place, you can run the application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run your_app_file_name.py
```

*(Replace `your_app_file_name.py` with the actual name of your Python script).*

The app will open automatically in your default web browser.

## üîß Project Structure

  - `your_app_file_name.py`: The main Python script containing all the Streamlit code.
  - `Random_forest_model (2).pkl`: The pre-trained machine learning model saved using `joblib`.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the app.
  - `LICENSE`: The license file for the project (e.g., MIT License).

## üìà The Model

This application is powered by a **Random Forest Regressor** model.

  - **Why Random Forest?**
      - **High Accuracy**: It combines the predictive power of multiple decision trees, leading to more accurate and stable predictions.
      - **Robustness**: It handles complex, non-linear relationships in the data and is less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees.
      - **Interpretability**: A key benefit is its ability to measure feature importance, which is leveraged in the dashboard to explain which input variables are most critical for the predictions.

The model was trained on a rich dataset to accurately capture the relationship between household characteristics, environmental conditions, and energy consumption.
